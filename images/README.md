## Images for Scripts

This directory is intended for storing images that correspond to the C++ scripts in the root directory. For the launcher to display an image for a specific script, the image file should be named to match the script file, but with a `.png` extension.

For example:
- For `zadanie1.cpp`, the image should be named `zadanie1.png`.
- For `lab2.cpp`, the image should be named `lab2.png`.

Please ensure all images are in the PNG format and are placed in this directory.
